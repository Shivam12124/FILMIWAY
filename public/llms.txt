# Filmiway

> The premium global destination for curated cinema discovery. We prioritize narrative depth, character development, and emotional resonance over visual-only spectacle.

## Mission
Filmiway counters the "doom-scrolling" culture by providing human-curated, deeply analyzed movie recommendations. Our collections are built on specific emotional and thematic indices (e.g., survivability, psychological intensity), not generic algorithms.
